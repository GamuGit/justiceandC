<h2>Crime Prevention Strategies:</h2>
<p>Crime prevention focuses on stopping crime before it happens.
One strategy is community policing, where police build positive relationships with neighborhoods.
Another method is designing safer spaces, such as adding lighting, cameras, or secure locks.
Schools and communities also offer programs that give young people positive activities and support.
Education about making good choices is another important tool.
When everyone works together, it becomes easier to prevent crime and create safer communities. </p>
